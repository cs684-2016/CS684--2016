Project Description:

Using IoT technology, we are proposing a new kind of memory drives called smart IoT Memory drives. Days are gone when someone needs pc to exchange data with the pendrive. But with this smart drive we wonâ€™t need PC  for exchanging the data. Not only this, it will also allow to transfer data over local area network as well as over the internet too.
